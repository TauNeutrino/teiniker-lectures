Exercise: Servlet - Login Attack (Lock Out)
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Given a simple Web application:

	URL: http://localhost:8080/Servlet-Login-Attack-Exercise/index.html

you can log in with the following input:

	username: homer
	password: homer
	=> Welcome, homer !

But this Web application has serious problems. It is not protected 
against brute force attacks. 

Brute Force Attack Prevention: 
	Limit the number of possible login failures for a particular 
	username to 3, so that the application behaves like:
	
		username: homer
		password: lisa
		=> Login for user homer failed!
		
		username: homer
		password: bart
		=> Login for user homer failed!	
		
		username: homer
		password: marge
		=> Login for user homer failed!
		
		username: homer
		password: burns
		=> User homer is locked!
	
		username: homer
		password: homer
		=> User homer is locked!
	
		... for ever!!	
	
	To unlock a user we have to restart the application (in practice
	we have to release the lock after a period of time).

	Tipp: Create a static Map<String,Integer> that counts the illegal
	attempts of each user. In the case of a successful login you can
	reset this count.
